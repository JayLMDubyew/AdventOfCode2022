# AdventOfCode2022


(Not-so) Fun Fact: When I  got to Day 12, I lost a fight with a Japanese Maple tree and had to recover for a week. Obviously, this has killed my momentum, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to make time to continue with the holidays winding up. 

I'll try to (but probably won't) pick up where I left off.
